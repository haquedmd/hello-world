# hello-world
I am new to code and excited to learn

I was inspired by PatMo141 who has created amazing Open Dental CAD modes in Blender and want to learn what I am doing. I am
attempting to learn code and what I can do. I am proficient with E4D, CEREC, and ConeBeam software (iCat Vision, InVivo 
Anatomage, SimPlant), but now have a 3D printer and want to get that rolling with dental functionality. PatMo141's vision is 
just what I need for that to happen.
